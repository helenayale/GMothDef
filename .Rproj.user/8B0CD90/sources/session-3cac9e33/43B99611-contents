# GMothDef

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

GMothDef is designed for the study of spongy moth defoliation. The goal is to to run each data processing in one line. 

Current functions include:

dat_tiff(): import and extract data from a set of Tiff files, each of which include same amount of band layers ordered in the same way
dat_folder(): import and extract data from single layer files grouped by band names in separate folders
dat_int(): interpolate data
dat_smth(): smooth data with LOESS smoothing method
smth_span(): compare the smoothing results with different smoothing spans
rf_reg(): build random forest regression model
predict_dat(): predict data using a random forest model


## Installation

You can install the development version of GMothDef from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("helenayale/GMothDef")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GMothDef)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
